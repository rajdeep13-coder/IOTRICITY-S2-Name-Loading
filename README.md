# ‚òÄÔ∏è IoTricity_S2 Solar Panel Monitor
---
## üìù Description  

The **IoTricity Solar Panel Monitor** is a smart IoT + ML project that optimizes the energy efficiency of solar panels.  
Using **Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs)** and **servo motors**, the system tracks the sun‚Äôs movement to adjust panel orientation.  

Unlike traditional trackers, this system features a **dual approach**:  
- **Rule-Based Local Control** ‚Üí Works on Arduino logic for real-time tracking, even without internet.  
- **Cloud-Integrated ML Control** ‚Üí Sends sensor data to a **FastAPI backend** deployed on the cloud, where trained ML models predict the **optimal horizontal and vertical tilt** of the solar panels.  

The project ensures **maximum energy capture** under varying light conditions, while also providing **IoT dashboard integration** for monitoring.  
This makes it ideal for **hackathon prototyping**, **student projects**, and a foundation for **scalable smart energy solutions**.

## üìå Overview
**IoTricity Solar Panel Monitor** is an IoT + ML powered project designed for smart solar tracking.  
It monitors **light intensity, panel orientation, and environmental parameters** to automatically optimize the tilt of solar panels for maximum efficiency.  

We implemented **two approaches**:
- üîπ **Rule-Based Local Tracking** ‚Üí Uses LDR sensors and servo logic (Arduino).  
- üîπ **Cloud-Integrated ML Tracking** ‚Üí Uses ESP32 + FastAPI ML API to predict the best panel angles in real time.

## ‚ú® Features
- Real-time LDR sensor data acquisition.  
- Dual-mode: **Rule-based fallback** & **ML-based cloud tracking**.  
- Servo-based alignment of solar panels.  
- Cloud-hosted **FastAPI** model inference.  
- IoT dashboard ready (ThingSpeak integration possible).  
- Sweeping fallback in low-light conditions.

## üìì Jupyter Notebooks
- `train_model.ipynb`: Trains the XGBoost model for predicting optimal panel angles, saves to `.joblib`.
- `preprocessing.ipynb`: Processes LDR sensor data and visualizes panel alignment performance.

- Accuracy limited by LDRs (could use better sensors).  

**Opportunities**  
- Scale for **large solar farms**.  
- Integrate with **predictive weather APIs**.  
- Use **AI-based energy optimization** for smart grids.  

**Threats**  
- Market competition with commercial trackers.  
- Harsh weather can damage low-cost sensors.  
- Dependency on cloud costs for scaling.
